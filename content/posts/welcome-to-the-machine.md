_Computation is the currency of the 21st century_

If you don't believe me then tell me why NVIDIA's stock is at an unsustainable high. It was actually laughable thinking that this stock was going to dip after reporting earnings, for anyone to believe that they were not going to crush expectations.

Most people see the AI trend and believe it parallels the dot com bubble, or will crash and burn like the Web3 hype that was spoon-fed to us. However, I believe that what is happening in AI is much different and more sinister.

This isn't a plea that AI is going to take our jobs or kill us all, I believe that we are very far from that future. In fact I am somewhat unimpressed of LLMs and their capabilities and I believe most developers would feel the same way.

I fear that AI will sterilize us. Convenience has now made its way into artistry. We now have a way to consume content that was not made by anybody, with no intended audience. If you think Marvel movies have gone bland, buckle up.
