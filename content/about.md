_Greetings Neighbor!_

<br/>

This is a collection of thoughts, ideas and notes that I want to publish. My hope for this blog and podcast is to facilitate thought, not only in myself, but others as well.

<br/>

Here we will talk about anything that can be computed, and argue what can't.

<br/>

Suggestions, questions or inquires can be directed to **[sandmancode@gmail.com](mailto:sandmancode@gmail.com)**

<br/>

Ciao!
